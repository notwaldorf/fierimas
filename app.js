        Count up every tweet he's made today, and you must find a product that \
        contains that number of items. <br><br> \
        For example, if that babbling cesspool \
        manages to type seven whiny factless tweets this morning at 3am, then \
        you must find a package of, say, seven donuts. Or seven markers. Or \
        seven something. If he hasn't tweeted at all yet today, take a deep \
        breath, thank the odd circumstances that brought you here, and instead \
        you must find something that comes in a package of two."
